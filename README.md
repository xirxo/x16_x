# x16_x
ðŸ’» A simple 16-bit virtual machine

# Getting started
## Prerequisite
You'd need [`deno`](https://deno.land 'Deno') and [`git`](https://git-scm.org 'Git')

## Cloning
To clone this project to your local machine, simply use Git.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/xirxo/x16_x.git
```

## Running
To run the VM, you'd need Deno. I will add supports for NodeJS in later version.
```
$ clear && deno run -qA ./src/index.ts
```
You can also execute the [`run`](https://github.com/xirxo/x16_x/blob/main/run.sh) file.
```
$ ./run
```

## Targetting
Currently, this is not possible.
